- do [try.github.io](https://try.github.io) (15min)

## Tutroial Guide

Ok so now that we have some files and a server we need to work on making sure it works with everyone.

When working with other people some considerations need to be made

- not a single person is aware of the whole project so writing tests becomes even more important.
- we need a system for collaboration.

In this lab we will get you familiar with git and the git flow

and write some tests

You will clone the repo form your respective repository the syntax for finding your tutorial rep is se-2016-[c,d,b]-[tutorial_number] -  c,d,b is th first letter of your major eg: se-2016-c-15 for CSEN tutorial 15.
